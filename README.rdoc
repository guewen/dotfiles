= Guewen Baconnier Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

== Environment

I am running on GNU/Linux and my dotfiles include :
 - zsh (with oh-my-zsh)
 - vim
 - tmux
 - ruby
 - python

The oh-my-zsh install procedure is described on : 

  https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

To install: 

  exuberant-ctags
  xsel
  ack-grep

Python modules:

  fancycompleter

== Features

If there are some shell configuration settings which you want secure or 
specific to one system, place it into a ~/.localrc file. This will be 
loaded automatically if it exists.

There are several features enabled in Ruby's irb including history and 
completion. Many convenience methods are added as well such as "ri"
which can be used to get inline documentation in IRB. See irbrc and
railsrc files for details.
